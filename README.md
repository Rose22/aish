# AIsh

This is a basic Linux shell that uses your chosen AI model to automatically run linux commands based on what you want. You can also use it like a normal linux shell, with the benefit of the ai auto correcting any typos.

It connects to any openAI API compatible server (such as a local model, or any openAI server in the cloud)
